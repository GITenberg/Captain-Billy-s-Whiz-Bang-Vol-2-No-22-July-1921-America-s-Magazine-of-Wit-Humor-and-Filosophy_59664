<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">My friend Norton took me around Minneapolis
recently on an evening’s jaunt to see the
“sights.” After visiting two or three moonlit
stores, Norton suggested that I be introduced to his
sweetheart. Brother Norton, being fairly well varnished
with fusel oil and white mule, called at the
wrong house. A colored maid answered the door bell.</p>

<p>“Is (hic) Daisy at home?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No, suh,” replied the maid.</p>

<p>“Then is Pansy here?” said Norton.</p>

<p>“No, suh.”</p>

<p>“Does Violet live here?”</p>

<p>“No, suh.”</p>

<p>“Then is (hic) Rose in?”</p>

<p>“No, suh, and look here, Mistuh, dis place ain’t
no hot house.”</p>

<p>After which I led Brother Norton back to the
flivver and we sojourned to Dutch’s stag cafe for the
remainder of the evening.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>I’ve found another use for my flivver: Deacon
Miller’s suckling colt followed old Lizzie for half a
mile the other day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">While at my Breezy Point cabin resort at
Pequot I heard an interesting story regarding
the manner in which young Indian men woo
their sweethearts.</p>

<p>When the Indian feels a tug at his heart he will
station himself with a tom-tom in front of the tepee
of his beloved and beat frantically on the drum affair.
If the girl loves him she comes out and the medicine
man does the rest. If she scorns his love she places
a snow-shoe at the wigwam entrance and the young
chief goes back to his own tepee and keeps on beating
his tom-tom until some squaw girl takes pity and
marries him.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Maggie, our new harvest cookhouse chef, lost
her brooch the other night, so she has prepared
the following advertisement for the Whiz
Bang: “LOST—A cameo brooch representing Venus
and Adonis on the Robbinsdale road about ten o’clock
on Wednesday evening.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We’ve had a good laugh on our neighbor, Deacon
Callahan, since the episode several of us
witnessed in front of the Palace Shoe Store in
Robbinsdale the other evening. The Deacon saw his
wife coming down the street, so he hid in the doorway
of the Palace. When she passed him, he jumped out
suddenly and kissed her. Instead of the scream he
expected, she hoarsely whispered: “Don’t be so bold,
mister. Folks ’round here know me.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Johnnie Beaton, of Ranier, Minn., tells about
a period in his life when old John Law grabbed
out and placed him in the Ranier calaboose. He
had been inside but a short time when one of the local
civic improvement “birds” handed him the usual circular
asking a donation for the improvement of the
local jail. Johnnie replied: “The present jail is good
enough to suit me.” Half an hour later, he organized
a stud poker game. As usual, the sucker squawked.
His reply to the saphead was pert and to the point:
“Sh! keep still. Do you want to get thrown out of
here?”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">The “no booze” edict for soldiers during the
recent friction with Germany raised havoc with
some of us rum-soaked sinners, but it also had its
comical side at times. I remember a system I put
into effect in Camp Lee. The first sergeant was
informed that no passes would be granted to visit
Pennsylvania points (Pennsy was wet) unless the fortunate
man returned with proper credentials, said credentials
to be deposited upon arrival in the top drawer
of the skipper’s desk in the orderly room. It was my
duty to check properly the pass“port.”</p>

<p>In our organization was a lieutenant whom we
will call Evans for short. Once upon a time Evans
was in a mess (he often was, as far as that goes, but
this time I mean a mess where we eat), and in that
mess there also was a colonel—a man of meanness
and incidentally a strict teetotaller. This colonel saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
or thought he saw, in Evans a gentleman after his own
heart—a steady, yea, even puritanical, officer.</p>

<p>One early morning, Evans returned from a pass
to Altoona, Pa., and flopped his weary way to the mess
hall. Collapsing in a seat, he played with his fork
and tried to look sober for a few minutes, and then
giving it up he concentrated on grub—or rather on
waiters.</p>

<p>Near the mantelpiece in the mess stood what
appeared to Evans to be the waiter on duty, and he
addressed this person—the only other person in the
mess—rather gruffly, I’m afraid.</p>

<p>“Heah—hic—orderly!” he exploded. “D’yuh
think I’m—hic—sitting here—hic—merely to provide
you—hic—with a spectacle? I want some food....”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, lieutenant,” came the acid reply,
“that you are providing me with a spectacle.”</p>

<p>“Good Gawsch!” spluttered Evans. “I thought
you were an orderly. I beg pardon, major; I didn’t
shee you were the—hic—colonel.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Speaking of abbreviated dress brings to mind a
recent occurrence in the St. Paul ball park, whence
I had flivvered to watch Minneapolis lose to the
Saints. Coming out, after the game, I bumped into a
small boy who had become lost in the crowd. Upon
inquiring why he was crying, he howled: “I lost my
mama.” “Why didn’t you hold to her skirts?” I
asked. “I tried to,” wept the kid, “but I couldn’t
reach them.”</p>

<p><i>California society whisperers frown on Edna
Purviance’s rumored engagement to scion of Los Angeles
wealth? Can it be Larry Semon “beat up” his
leading lady, Lucille Carlisle? And Katherine McDonald
has something to worship! The male sissy
of the screen! Natalie Talmadge may find a snag in
Buster Keaton’s backyard? Join our monthly movie
gossip club! These dainty morsels are gathered by
the Hollywood correspondent of this great family
journal.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">By RICHMOND.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Of all girls in the movies, Edna Purviance has
the softest snap. In the last year and a half,
almost two years, Charlie Chaplin has only made
one picture, “The Kid,” which barely occupied more
than a few weeks of Edna’s time. It’s true Edna
doesn’t earn much compared to the other stars or
leading women of the screen—they say her contract
with Charlie gives her only $100 a week—but she has
time—loads of it—and Edna plays the social game in
that spare time and doesn’t appear to worry her pretty
head about her career or future fame. She has an
attractive but modest apartment, a not too expensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
car and maid and puts everything on her clothes, which
are of the smartest.</p>

<p>About two years ago Carleton Burke of Los Angeles
began to “rush” Edna. Carleton is considered the
catch of the Pacific coast. He is wealthy—his family
is A-1 socially, Carleton is handsome, traveled and
well educated and has made a name as a polo player.
He is also a member of all the exclusive men’s clubs
in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Well, of course, when Carleton first took up Edna
there was much whispering concerning a Venice bungalow,
after Charlie “discovered” the fair manicurist
in a small town near Frisco Bay. Could she be received?
If Carleton Burke meant to marry her, of
course, she’d be taken up eventually anyhow, and the
Burkes are not the sort of people you can snub. So
Carleton’s sister, Louise, entertained Edna. The Claus
Spreckels at Coronada did the same and a few other
of the selects followed the lead. Edna accepted these
favors with a very calm and ladylike demeanor quite
as if she had a perfect right to the best of social life,
and she created a favorable impression. Edna has
sense enough not to carry vulgar studio movie talk
into the drawing rooms of people who wouldn’t understand.
She is never forward or bold and, with her undeniable
beauty, is surely an asset to any function.</p>

<p>However, Carleton has continued to take Edna
about—to the Midwick and other exclusive country
clubs, but marriage has never “come off.” Through
Burke, Edna became acquainted with Mrs. Sallie Polk
Merritt of Pasadena—an attractive brunette of social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
standing but whose name has been mentioned in a few
sensational divorce mix-ups. Sallie and Edna are
bosom friends and go everywhere together.</p>

<p>It is now whispered about Los Angeles that the
Burke family has decided against the marriage.</p>

<p>Rather hard on Edna if she loves him, isn’t it?
We don’t really know whether she cares particularly
or not.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Can it be that Larry Semon spanks his leading
lady love, Lucille Carlisle, when she doesn’t do
as he likes? There was such a violent spanking
in the environs of the Vitagraph lot recently, that
Lucille retired to a hospital for a rest, and a new leading
lady replaced her.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is said the beautiful Katherine Macdonald, picture
star, earns a mere $40,000 per picture now. Despite
the fact that Katherine looks eternally sad in her
pictures and shows not a glimmer of cheer or sense of
humor, people like to gaze on the American beauty and
her clothes. Anyhow her backers must make a profit
or they wouldn’t come through with the “40 thou.”
Now, it is said Katherine saves nearly every cent. She
is reported quite the most saving woman on the screen.</p>

<p>The social set like Katherine because she doesn’t
get spiflicated and run around with promiscuous ordinary
movie folk, and because she holds herself “cold
and high.” The studio folk on her own lot say she is
“hard,” and that she won’t let them hire blondes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
her pictures because the sunlight has a way of making
light hair stand out conspicuously, and thus detracts
from her own person.</p>

<p>Every week or so a San Francisco man named Morrell
comes south, and they say he visits Katherine. The
couple are engaged, it is said, and when her two-year
contract is up, intend to marry and quit business for
good. Friends say they are both saving carefully
toward that day.</p>

<p>The arithmetical problem is this: If Morrell earns
“X” salary and Katherine $40,000 per picture or about
$240,000 a year, how much salt and pepper will Morrell’s
savings buy two years from now? How many
steaks and cream puffs can Katherine buy?</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">In a recent issue we dealt somewhat with the male
sissy whose devastating inroads have made themselves
particularly felt in this Egyptianesque hotbed
of art, near art and the no end of things for which
poor art is blamed—Hollywood.</p>

<p>Our readers will recall that some months ago a very
noted “heavy” of the films, a man nearing the fifties
and with a wealth of apparent masculine comeliness,
was arrested in company with another male person
after a perfectly inquisitive detective had watched
them through a keyhole of the film star’s home.</p>

<p>Broken in the prime of life, an object of scorn and
with others fearing to be seen in his company, even for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
business purposes, his plight is a sorry one. More seldom
as the months pass does his white head and
Romanesque profile appear upon the screen.</p>

<p>There is grim humor in the plight of this man. The
name of an immensely rich woman was mentioned in
connection with his arrest. It was intimated that he
had grown cold in his attentions to her and that the
detective who trapped the two men was well paid with
feminine gold. She must have suspected something.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Wedding bells and hopeful love of man and
woman seems to have broken out afresh in the
picture world. Wasn’t it in an issue four
months back that we confidentially confided to our
readers that Charlie Chaplin was openly adoring a
sweet young thing of seventeen? Just about four
months after we cheered you with this item, the daily
papers declaimed that all signs and portents were to
the effect that May Collins was to become the second
bride of the comedian.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Miss Collins by this time has been
“interviewed.” With the awe-striking wisdom of
seventeen—some say she is younger—the girl sets
forth, or so she is quoted, a panacea for marriage ills.
She did not admit she was going to marry Charlie but
she wasted no space in praising anyone but him. It
appears that if May marries Charlie that the path of
true art will not be tampered with and if Charles
wishes to remain out on business, or otherwise further
his picture activities, that May will not offer hindrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred Harris, too, was seventeen when she married

<p class="dropcap">When Buster Keaton goes out in the evening he
takes his whole family. There are so many
of them we’ve lost count. Anyhow, when he
goes down to Sunset Inn at Santa Monica the waiters
have to move three tables and put them together so
that all Buster’s family can be seated. There are several
sisters and as many younger brothers and a “Pa”
and lots of aunts and uncles. And Buster cheerfully
pays the bill.</p>

<p>A little incident has been reported to the correspondent
of this great family journal. It appears Buster
had been out with some lady of whom his father
objected, or had done something which his “Pa” didn’t
like and there was an argument over at the Metro
studio. “Pa” perhaps hasn’t forgotten his ancient and
pleasant right of parental authority. However, Buster
is resourceful. It is said he put “Pa” in his dressing-room
and locked him up for the night, going on about
his own business thereafter.</p>

<p>We wonder, if, when Natalie Talmadge marries
Buster this spring, she will have to lock his family in
the closets occasionally in order to prevent little rows!</p>

<h3>The Tale of a Shirt</h3>

<p>Comfort, the farmers’ journal, says this: Is there
any way for a girl to tell her sweetheart his shirt-tail
is out? The same way she would tell her brother or
cousin or any friend. A sweetheart’s shirt-tail is no
more sacred or worthy of respect than any other shirt-tail.
A tail belongs to a shirt as much as cuffs or a
collar and isn’t any more indecent. I’d tell anyone to
tuck his shirt in—just like that.</p>

<p>She was a silly little, gushing thing, and habitually
talked without thinking, and in the exaggerated fashion
which the female of the species at present affects.
Lately married, she was able to induce her adoring
hubby to go with her on shopping expeditions. Even
when the tour included a visit to an establishment
where the most intimate of feminine garments were on
sale, he did not flinch.</p>

<p>In one such shop, the discreet manageress inquired
as to whether a certain set of silken unmentionables,
recently purchased, had given full satisfaction.</p>

<p>The little bride’s eyes grew round.</p>

<p>“Oh, they were beautiful!” she burst out, in her
usual fashion. “Everybody admired them—everybody!”</p>

remarked, “You’d be surprised how far we can see
with this little instrument.”</p>

<h2><i>A Dilemna De Luxe</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">By MARGARET MANNERS</p>

<p>It was embarrassing, to say the least! The young
man strove vainly to retain his equilibrium, also his
hold upon the inert form in his arms. But the color
mounted in a vivid flush of red to his very blonde hair.</p>

<p>Then the nearby group of watchers laughed. He
was still more confused. The auburn locks of the fair
figure in his arms became loosened and fell in a cascade
almost to the floor. The man was visibly disconcerted,
and letting go with one hand, he clutched at
his collar and gazed wildly down at the cold, upturned
face.</p>

<p>With a renewed effort to escape the taunting eyes
of the curious, snickering crowd, he gathered the slim
figure to him once more, when a shout went up and,
looking back, he saw that the gown he had hastily
loosened at the neck of the fair vision when he had
first come upon the scene, had slipped off and lay in a
soft silken heap at his feet. He was painfully aware
that all that remained to view was the daintiest of
filmy lingerie, and sheer, silken hosiery. One tiny
pump had fallen off.</p>

<p>The young man thought he would faint if he did
not escape the crowd that had rapidly grown to a curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mob. The sight of a very flushed youth, holding
the limp female figure in his awkward arms, scantily
clad, beautiful face impassive, instead of exciting sympathy,
brought forth only mirth at his clumsy attempts
to withdraw. Evidently such an experience had never
occurred to the embarrassed youth before, but he rallied
and finally reached the door.</p>

<p>As he started through, carefully, almost tenderly
holding the lovely form, the delicate crepe de chine
underslip caught on the little glass doorknob; to his
utter chagrin, he let go altogether, leaning against the
framework of the door; this was too much!</p>

<p>Wildly he thought of abandoning his duty, when
the stern voice of a very dapper, wax-mustached, and
excited gentleman who forced his way through the
door, brought him up with a jerk.</p>

<p>“What ees the matter with you?” almost shrieked
the head floorwalker of “The Elite Modes” shop.
“Look, look!” he cried, gesticulating wildly, “worse
than ze bull in ze china-closet! Go back to where you
belong, and stay there!”</p>

<p>The new window dresser of “The Elite Modes”
gave one look at the broken nose of the wax window-model
which he had dropped, and fled—back to his
old love, the gingham department!</p>

<h3>The Sinai Joke</h3>

<p>A bishop who had been widely advertised for a
speech at Westminster Abbey, was greeted by a record-breaking
audience. The famous Abbey was crowded
to the doors.</p>

<p>As the bishop stepped to the rostrum and opened
the good book he said, “I will take for my text today,
‘And when the Lord ascended Mt. Sinai, What did he
say?’” And, looking at those assembled in the balcony,
he said again, in a louder voice, “‘And when
the Lord ascended Mt. Sinai, What did he say?’” And
once again, looking upward to the gallery, he shouted
(as if waiting for an answer), “‘And when the Lord
ascended Mt. Sinai, What did he say?’”</p>

<p>A little Australian buddy, unable to contain himself
any longer, rose from his place in the rear and,
standing on his seat, raised his hand: “I’ll bite,
bishop, wot did ’e say?”</p>

with only a casual glance. The colonel, feeling somewhat
different, addressed the lad in an impressive
voice: “Young man, how long have you been here?”
The rookie’s face radiated surprise and gladness at
having thus been noticed by an apparent old timer, and
he eagerly replied: “Why, I been here three days, how
long you been here?”</p>

<h2><i>California Beach Nuts</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center sans">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">California’s coast is a big bathing beach. The
state is not only famous for its walnuts, but for
its beach nuts one sees every day, especially
Sunday.</p>

<p>The ocean strand is covered with half-dressed
women, boys and girls sprawled out like goats and
satyrs hugging the shore and each other. It is the playground
of the sexes.</p>

<p>At many bathing resorts Sunday is anything but
religious. The cross gives way to Cupid’s bow and
arrow. The Bible is the book of nature done in calf.
Brown lads lie with their heads in the laps of half-naked
brunettes, forgetting that to do so and not mean
harm is “hypocrisy to the devil” who tempts their
virtue. They make no attempt to hide under beach
umbrellas. One may question their propriety, but
neither their nerve nor shape. Their speech is low,
but if actions speak louder than words, their conduct
is often vulgar if not vicious. We saw a place advertised
as the “safest beach,” but without falling into
the deep water we fear the devil’s undertow is carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
many out beyond their moral depth. “Love one another”
is the favorite text, and the “laying on of
hands” is not omitted. All the flesh-pots were not in
Egypt. Cleopatra had a good time on the Nile and
“Clara” has the same time here. We saw many couples
and decided that more marriages were made on the
beach than in heaven. Position in society is everything.
Here there was everything in position. Heads
in laps, arms around waists, boys in girls’ laps, girls
in boys’, legs linked, or arms and legs tied up in lover’s
bow-knots. All were taking “Sea”estas in their
“surge” suits. The sight was very “surf”eiting. In
this Cupid school we saw girls with pearly teeth, but
with no pearls of wisdom; many who could paint their
face, but not paint a Madonna; girls who could play
with the boys, but not the piano; the only apparent
study was that of anatomy.</p>

<p>Breakers on the beaches are divided into three
classes: ocean-breakers, law-breakers and heart-breakers.
California is a fruit state and we looked everywhere
to see the “peaches” on the beaches—but most
of them were dried, and there were more old Iowa
valetudinarians and bearded bipeds than anyone else.
Timon of Athens was a misanthrope who went to the
seashore to get away from mankind. Had he come to
this beach, the day we were there, he would have
prayed for a tidal wave to wipe it off the map.</p>

<p>Scripture says of the beautiful lilies, “they toil not,
neither do they spin.” Of these painted, half-dressed,
lounging, walking, posturing beach-combers with their
dry feet, we say, “They toil not, neither do they swim.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
We came away from the beach that Sunday with a
composite picture of pop-eyed, pot-bellied promenaders
in the sand, vulgar Venuses, wobbly wenches, living
links, heavy-hipped hags, sinuous, shrunken men, tattered
tights, tousled head nymphs, and vain cock of
the walks admiring their own shape and gazing on
their feet and fingernails.</p>

<p>We wish we could forget the bather’s singularity
and angularity, the plethoric paunch, the blinking,
bawling, calling, sprawling, mawling, drawling, squalling
figures that defaced the beauty of the sky, the sea
and the sand. Oh, the water cataracts running and
dripping from shaking sides, heavy hips and swinging
busts! If Ulysses and his crew sailed by this shore
with its sweating sirens and howling hurdy-gurdies,
they would stop their ears—but not for fear of being
enticed ashore.</p>

<p>The poet sings of the “smile” of the sea—we do
not wonder at laughing waves when they see some of
the freak styles. What are the wild waves saying?
Some things we think we better omit. To watch this
beach of bathers is like having a front seat at the
Winter Garden Follies. The visitor may study the
contour of beach and bathers. Here he meets the
living skeleton of angles and the bag of bones, as well
as her heavy-set sister with all her capricious curves,
crests, elevations and depressions. How unlike the
pictures in the Sunday supplements, and how like the
caricatures in the comic supplement. When first they
appear all nice and dry they are passable, but look
at them if you dare and can, when they take a dip or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
flop and come out with their homely lines all emphasized.
No Greek statues, no things of beauty and joy
forever, but shattered, disenchanting dreams, or nightmares
rather.</p>

<p>Farewell to this flotsam and jetsam, foam and
scum, these sand-flies. If you want to have a “good
time,” go to the beach where the volume of nature and
human nature is “wide open.” The text books you
should bring and study on the seashore are Shelley,
Burns, Sand, Crabbe and Bacon.</p>

<h3>Another Jellyfish</h3>

<p>“Boys,” asked the school master, “what do you

<p>“Flowers,” ventured another.</p>

<p>Both answers were received with favor, and the
turn went to a hefty youth.</p>

<p>“A woman,” announced he gruffly.</p>

<p>“Come out here,” commanded the master, sternly.</p>

<p>A good flogging was administered; and then the
offender was bidden to go home and tell his father that
he had been flogged, and why.</p>

<p>Next morning the floggee was again hauled up.</p>

<p>“Did you tell your father that you had been
flogged?” asked the master.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him why?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, dad and I talked it all over between
us, and we’ve come to the conclusion that there’s something
funny about you.”</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Press dispatches recently carried an item to the
effect that although slightly mentally affected,
the mother of Charlie Chaplin, upon her son’s
earnest persuasion, had been allowed to enter this
country from England.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chaplin, upon reaching New York, stood a
chance, it was stated, of having to return had it not
been for quick and effective energies of her sons and
their friends in political power.</p>

<p>Those who know Chaplin well declare that the intense
melancholy for which he is noted is due more
than anything else to the affection and concern for his
mother. Such things as domestic troubles, it is said,
bear little weight with the man who daily makes millions
laugh. ’Tis the mother.</p>

<p>What have we here! Consider this monumental
fun-maker of the screen. Death is bad enough but when
the mind of one very dear becomes clouded, then indeed
does tragedy and sadness smite with a heavy hand.</p>

<p>We read of the circus clown whose wife and children
burned to death, and yet, to keep a date with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
world of fun lovers, he went ahead that night and
clowned as never he had clowned before. Have we in
Chaplin a great tragedy also? It will be recalled that
when he was a small boy in London he and his mother
and brother lived in a workhouse in order that the
streets might not be their home.</p>

<p>Now his mother is coming home to him, to live amid
all the luxury that great wealth may bring; wealth
that came after a sad little fellow with merry feet,
living in a workhouse with his mother, learned to be
the greatest of all fun-makers. Life’s a funny proposition,
folks, isn’t it?</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Half a century ago the nude in art was strange
enough in America to uplift Puritanic hands in
holy horror. Today, among all cultivated people,
the female nude is most matter-of-fact. Our notions
of art the country over have been steadily clarifying,
until at last the great distinction has been recognized
and conceded even by pious folk that, while the
human male figure is impossible, the female form is
purely beautiful.</p>

<p>Those rabid for realism and resolutely uncompromising,
will have the assurance to claim innocuousness
for the undraped male; but the opinion today among
those who are not extremists is still definitely against
the frank exposition of the male form in plastic or
painting.</p>

<p>At worst the mind receives merely a filip of interest;
and complete nudity, to the male fancy, repeated
again and again in art, speedily sates curiosity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with that, incipient desire. As for the minds of women,
no one would insult them with the suspicion that
they find anything provocative in the portrayal of
figures of their own sex.</p>

<p>In every landscape the eye notices at once and unavoidably
the hills; it finds the plains and valleys only
by an effort of the will. This fact has ever been
admitted by the modern stage, which is, so far as the
ethics of objective morality go, more conservative than
modern art in its advanced attitude.</p>

have a good dinner and then smear a little red paint
around. How about it?”</p>

<h3>Then His Nerve Failed</h3>

<p>One of the loveliest of girls went into a gents’
furnishing store to buy a necktie. She hesitated a
moment, and then asked in a nice, straightforward
way: “I want to put it on, please. Would you tie it
for me?”</p>

<p>The clerk felt a little nervous, especially as the
other fellows were watching him, but she had already
pulled off the necktie that she wore. He said, “Certainly,”
and, putting the new one around her neck as
she ducked her head. She wore a dainty white silk
shirt. When the tie was tied, the ends seemed a bit
long, and he suggested: “Do you wear the ends tucked
in?” “Yes,” she returned with unembarrassed absentmindedness.
At this point his courage failed him.</p>

<div class="verse">All his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless “shine,”</div>
<div class="verse indent2">They called him “Strike-out Casey” from the mayor on down the line.</div>
<div class="verse">And as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The lane is long, some one has said, that never has a turn again,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And Fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men.</div>
<div class="verse">And Casey smiled—his rugged face no longer wore a frown;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.</div>
<div class="verse">All Mudville had assembled; ten thousand fans had come</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;</div>
<div class="verse">And when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He doffed his cap in proud disdain—but Casey only smiled.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Play ball,” the umpire’s voice rang out, and then the game began;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan</div>
<div class="verse">Who thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Their hopes sank low—the rival team was leading “four to one.”</div>
<div class="verse">The last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.</div>
<div class="verse">The din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When the pitcher hit the second and gave “four balls” to the third.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Three men on bases—no one out—three runs to tie the game,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A triple meant the highest niche in Mudville’s hall of fame;</div>
<div class="verse">But here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<div class="verse indent2">When the fourth one “fouled to catcher” and the fifth “flew out at right,”</div>
<div class="verse">A dismal groan in chorus came—a scowl was on each face—</div>
<div class="verse indent2">When Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;</div>
<div class="verse">His bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">There were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day.</div>
<div class="verse">They hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored “strike him out.”</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard this shout.</div>
<div class="verse">The pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it sped;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Another hiss, another groan—“strike one” the umpire said.</div>
<div class="verse">Zip—like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee—</div>
<div class="verse indent2">“Strike two” the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">No roasting for the umpire now—his was an easy lot.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But here the pitcher whirled again—was that a rifle shot?</div>
<div class="verse">A whack, a crack, and out through space the leather pellet flew—</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.</div>
<div class="verse">About the fence in center field in rapid whirling flight,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The ball sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.</div>
<div class="verse">Ten thousand hats were thrown in air, then thousand threw a fit;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun;</div>
<div class="verse">And somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">But Mudville hearts are happy now—for Casey hit the ball.</div>

<h3>Monkey Shines</h3>

<p>Two young men were riding on a street car which
I chanced to squeeze onto with some 249 other adults.</p>

<p>“I took my first drink last night, Algernon,” said
one of the pair.</p>

<p>“Did you, Clarence? Honestly, where did you get
it?” queried the other.</p>

<p>“Down at a near beer parlor. It was real near
beer, too, with one-half of one per cent alcohol and
everything.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been drinking, too,” said the other; “I had
two whole glasses of near beer the other night. I was
going to a party, you know, and wanted to get plenty
of pep.”</p>

<p>“Did you drink your near beer straight, or did you
dilute it with water?” asked Clarence.</p>

<p>“I drank it straight. I wanted to get the full
kick. Straight, you know, with a coupla chasers.”</p>

<p>“I certainly went crazy after I took that drink,
though. I thought I was going to try to sing at first,”
said Clarence.</p>

<p>“I hope none of my friends saw the way I acted
after I took that near beer the other night,” Algernon
put in. “I went batty right away. I started telling
all sorts of funny jokes and laughing ridiculously.
Went to see my girl immediately after, and she said
she could tell I had been drinking after I told her.
She promised not to tell it, though.”</p>

<h2><i>The Raptures of Cupid</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>In the April issue we published a model love
letter, and since then we have been deluged with
dimes from anxious swains asking us to hurry along
another letter, as their sweethearts had answered the
first and were expecting another. As we are always
ready to sympathize with crooning youths, and wish
to be obliging, we are offering another captivating
love note in the following</i>:</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">My dear Miss Gumptious: Every time I think of
you, my heart flops up and down like a churn
dasher. Sensations of unutterable joy caper
over it like young goats on a stable roof, and thrill
through it like Spanish needles through a pair of two
linen trousers. As a gosling swimmeth with delight in
a mud puddle, so swim I in a sea of glory. Visions
of ecstatic rapture, thicker than the hairs of a blacking
brush, and brighter than the hues of a humming bird’s
pinions, visit me in my slumbers; and, borne on their
invisible wings, your image stands before me, and I
reach out to grasp it, like a pointer snapping at a blue-bottle
fly. When I first beheld your angelic perfections
I was bewildered, and my brain whirled ’round like a
bumble bee under a glass tumbler. My eyes stood open
like cellar doors in a country town, and I lifted up my
ears to catch the silvery accents of your voice. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tongue refused to wag and in silent adoration I drank
in the sweet infection of love as a thirsty man swalloweth
a tumbler of hot whiskey punch.</p>

<p>Since the light of your face fell upon my life, I
sometimes feel as if I could lift myself up by my boot
straps to the top of the church steeple, and pull the bell
rope for singing school. Day and night you are in my
thoughts. When Aurora, rising from her saffron-colored
couch, blushing like a bride; when the jay bird
pipes his tuneful lay in the apple tree by the spring
house; when the chanticleer’s shrill clarion heralds the
coming morn; when the awakening pig ariseth from
his bed and grunteth, and goeth forth for his morning
refreshments; when the drowsy beetle wheels to droning
flight at sultry noontide; and when the lowing
herds come home at milking time, I think of thee; and,
like a piece of gum elastic, my heart seems stretched
clear across my bosom. Your hair is like the mane
of a sorrel horse, powdered with gold, and the brass
pins skewered through your water-fall fill me with
unbounded awe. Your forehead is smoother than the
elbow of an old coat; your eyes are glorious to behold.
In their liquid depths I see legions of little Cupids
bathing, like a cohort of ants in an old Army cracker.
When their fire hit me upon my manly breast, it penetrated
my whole anatomy, as a load of bird shot
through a rotten apple. Your nose is a chunk of Parian
marble, and your mouth is puckered with sweetness.
Nectar lingers on your lips, like honey on a bear’s paw;
and myriads of unfledged kisses are there, ready to
fly out and light somewhere, like bluebirds out of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
parents’ nest. Your laugh rings in my ears like the
windharp’s strain, or the bleat of a stray lamb on a
bleak hillside. The dimples in your cheeks are like
bowers in beds of roses—hollows in cakes of home-made
sugar.</p>

<p>I am dying to fly to thy presence, and pour out the
burning eloquence of my love, as thrifty housewives
pour out hot coffee. Away from you I am as melancholy
as a rat.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I can hear the June bugs of despondency
buzzing in my ears, and feel the cold lizards of
despair crawling down my back. Uncouth fears, like
a thousand minnows, nibble at my spirits; and my soul
is pierced with doubts, as an old cheese is bored with
skippers.</p>

<p>My love for you is stronger than the smell of patent
butter, or the kick of a young cow, and more unselfish
than a kitten’s first catterwaul. As a song bird
hankers for the light of day, the cautious mouse for
the fresh bacon in the trap, as a mean pup hankers after
new milk, so I long for thee.</p>

<p>You are fairer than a speckled pullet, sweeter than
a Yankee doughnut fried in sorghum molasses, brighter
than the top knot plumage of muscovy ducks. You are
candy, kisses, raisins, pound-cake and sweetened toddy
altogether.</p>

<p>If these few remarks will enable you to see the
inside of my soul, and me to win your affection, I shall
be as happy as a woodpecker on a cherry tree, or a
stage horse in a green pasture. If you cannot reciprocate
my thrilling passion, I will pine away like a poisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
bed bug, and fall away from a flourishing vine of
life an untimely branch; and, in the coming years, when
the shadows grow from the hills, and the philosophical
frog sings his cheerful evening hymn, you, happy in
another’s love can come and cast a tear and catch a cold
upon the last resting place of</p>

<p>KENYON COX in
SCRIBNER’S
MAGAZINE, says:</p>

<p>With the Greeks
and Florentines it
was a delight in
the beauty of
form, in which the
human figure exceeds
all other
beautiful things.
The Venetians added
a delight in the
exquisite color and
texture of the flesh.
They first perceived
that not
only was the
human body the
noblest in form
and line of all existing
objects, but
in color and softness
and exquisiteness
of Light and
Shade, the flesh of
a woman was more
lovely than pearls
or flowers, so a new
art of “NUDE”
came into existence.
The figure no
longer stood for the
expression of abstract
idea, but
was painted for its
own BEAUTY as
men paint FLOWERS
or LANDSCAPES.</p>

<p>Photographic reproduction
in black
and white of the
famous paintings
of the world. These
pictures in the originals
hang in the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
